  title: 'Modular Life: Learning Embedded WASM with Cellular Automaton'
  slug: modular-life
  blurb: |
    This series explores the embedding of WebAssembly (WASM) into Rust projects
    outside of the browser, using a cellular automaton simulation as an
    example. Aimed at those familiar with Rust but new to WebAssembly.
